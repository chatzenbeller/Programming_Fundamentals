1. Nouns and Verbs
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
A Dungeons & Dragons character creator. The character creator should ask the user to input their fantasy race and class, as well as ask them for inputs on their individual stats for that character. The program should take everything the user has input and output the results onto a character sheet. (There should also be an option to randomize stats.)

NOUNS:
character, race, class, stats, sheet

VERBS:
prompt, input, output, randomize

2. Defining Diagram
INPUT:
  charRace
  charClass
  stats --
  STR,DEX,CON,INT,WIS,CHA

PROCESSING:
  prompt the user for charRace
  prompt the user for charClass
  prompt the user for all of their stats
  OR
  random input for stats
  generate a character output from user input gathered
  display generate character sheet

OUTPUTS:
  race, class, stats
  characterSheet

3. Solution Algorithm
SOLUTION ALGORITHM:
displayCharacter
  initialize raceOptions[]
  initialize classOptions[]
  initialize stats[]

  initialize loopInput to true

  initialize inputRace
  initialize inputClass
  initialize inputStat

  declare character hash{
    hash entry charName
    hash entry charRace
    hash entry charClass
    hash entry statSTR
    hash entry statDEX
    hash entry statCON
    hash entry statINT
    hash entry statWIS
    hash entry statCHA}

  WHILE loopInputs == true
    character.name = prompt user for name
    inputRace = prompt user for inputRace
    IF inputRace == raceOptions
      character.race = inputRace
    ENDIF
    ELSE
